# Ultramarathon-Data-Analysis

# Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of ultramarathon participation and performance using a dataset spanning over two centuries. The project explores various trends, such as the impact of historical events on ultramarathons and gender dynamics in participation. Additionally, a predictive model was developed to forecast ultramarathon finishing times based on key variables.

# Features
Data Analysis: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights related to ultramarathon events.
Predictive Modeling: Developed a Random Forest model to predict ultramarathon finishing times, achieving an R² score of 0.689.
Feature Engineering: Extracted and engineered relevant features from the dataset, such as event distance, athlete age, and gender.
Visualization: Generated visualizations to illustrate trends and model performance.

# Dataset
The dataset includes ultramarathon results from 1970 to 2018, sourced from the Kaggle platform. It contains variables such as event distance, year, runner's age, gender, and finishing time.

# Results
Predictive Performance: The Random Forest model demonstrated a strong predictive ability with an R² score of 0.689, indicating a reliable fit for predicting ultramarathon finishing times.
Trends: The analysis highlighted significant trends, such as the increasing participation of women in ultramarathons and the impact of distance and age on finishing times.
